This repository contains finite difference solvers for the wave equation
in 1 through 6 dimensions.  An explicit Runge-Kutta method is used for
the time discretization and finite differences are used for the spatial
discretization.  A script is used to generate the spatial kernel, and can
use an arbitrary order stencil in each direction.
